    <h2 class="highlight">Benefits of Bodybuilding</h2>
    <p> Some people claim that there are no unique benefits to bodybuilding training –<em>aiming to increase muscle mass and decrease fat mass</em>.  They aver that bodybuilding is a waste of time because it (supposedly) only improves your appearance, not your performance. These people claim that one should do so-called "functional" training instead.  According to these people, calisthenics, Cross Fit, powerlifting, Olympic lifting, and gymnastics produce a more "functional" fitness than bodybuilding-style training. They maintain that if there are any benefits of bodybuilding, they can be more easily acquired, along with a more functional fitness, through these "functional" training methods.

      <h2>Bulk Season</h2>
<p>Bulking season is when you have to eat twice as much food as you usually intake daily. To have a successful bulking season, focus more on carbs which has way more calories than just chicken or beef. Focus on fats and caloric intake. Try to eat as much as you can throughout 6 months, that is the certain amount of time people take to bulk up with muscles. Don't only focus on getting big, focus on your nutrients as well. Get lean muscle mass by focusing on the protein and carbs intake.<a href="https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/what-is-the-best-bulking-program.html" class="external">The best bulking program for rookies.</a></p>

  <h3>Shred Season</h3>
  <p>Check your calendar. Uh, oh. Summer is closer than you probably realized. Now check the mirror. With beaches, rivers, lakes and pools serving as the venue for most of your social gatherings over the next 12 to 16 weeks, ask yourself: Am in a position to go clothing-minimal? If not, no worries; we’ve got you covered. At this stage in the game, the key is to dig in and commit to a training routine that’ll bring new life to your existing muscle while simultaneously sending fat to the great beyond. And it just so happens this is kind of our thing.The most common issue with getting lean for summer is that you often have to sacrifice a few hard-earned gains in the process. For the sake of a six-pack, it’s a trade-off most people reluctantly (but nearly always) make. But that doesn’t have to be the case.Most lifters getting ready for summer go overboard with training and pair that with a lower-calorie diet, which is an outdated and ineffective approach. It’s time to change things up and create a hybrid workout system that has a soft spot for hard size</p>
